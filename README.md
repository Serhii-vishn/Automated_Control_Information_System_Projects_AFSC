AFSC - Algorithm for scheduling classes

Planning your own time and resources is an integral part of everyone's life, but planning time (schedule) in the university is the most important, because the effectiveness of the planned schedule depends on the effectiveness of both students and teachers. Therefore, to automate and facilitate the work of the scheduling department, an information system has been proposed to speed up the planning process, which in turn will increase the efficiency of the department and provide new opportunities to work with data in the university.
